## Introduction

Selenium WebDriver is a powerful tool for automating web applications for testing purposes. It supports multiple browsers and programming languages, with Java being one of the most popular choices for writing Selenium tests. This repository is intended for learners who wish to grasp the fundamentals of Selenium WebDriver and explore its advanced features with Java.

## Selenium Basics

### What is Selenium WebDriver?

Selenium WebDriver is a component of the Selenium suite that allows you to write scripts in various programming languages to control web browsers programmatically. It provides a more sophisticated API compared to Selenium RC and allows you to perform tasks like clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating through web pages.

### Key Concepts

- **WebDriver**: Interface to control the browser.
- **WebElement**: Represents elements on a web page (e.g., buttons, text fields).
- **Locators**: Strategies to find elements on a web page (e.g., ID, Name, XPath, CSS Selector).
- **Browser Drivers**: Executables that interact with the browser (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver for Firefox).

### Basic Setup

To get started with Selenium WebDriver in Java:

1. **Install Java**: Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed.
2. **Set Up Project**: Use Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies.
3. **Add Selenium Dependency**: Include the Selenium WebDriver dependency in your project configuration file.

Example `pom.xml` for Maven:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
        <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
        <version>4.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Selenium 4 Features
#### Selenium 4 introduces several new features and enhancements:

**W3C WebDriver Standard:** 
Selenium 4 is fully compliant with the W3C WebDriver standard, improving compatibility and stability across different browsers.
**New Features:**
Enhanced Relative Locators: Locate elements relative to other elements.
Improved Window and Tab Management: Better control over multiple windows and tabs.
Native Events: Improved interaction with web elements through native events.
